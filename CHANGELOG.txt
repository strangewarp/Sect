-- TODO: Add a "CMD channel", where a sequence's non-NOTE commands are held.
-- TODO: Add a unique view-mode for the "CMD channel", based on stacking, rather than repeating-grid. CMD-channel seq-space should be parsed as normal seq-space, but POINTER_PREV_NOTE and POINTER_NEXT_NOTE should be triggered by the POINTER_UP and POINTER_DOWN buttons.
-- TODO: Add variables: "COMMAND TYPE", "BYTE VAL 1", and "BYTE VAL 2", which can be tabbed through when the "CMD channel" is active, via "NOTE", "DURATION", and "VELOCITY" keys.

-- TODO: Add full MIDI-IN, for composition via external MIDI devices.
-- TODO: Add native MIDI I/O on Windows, via lovemidi.

-- TODO: In Play Mode, notes from Shadow Mode sequences should play alongside notes from the active sequence.

-- TODO: comment out console again

-- Changed selection-commands and getNotes, so that only notes on the active channel are selected in a given selection-command.
-- Changed some note-functions so they won't overwrite notes that sit on different channels within the same sequence, when they share pitch values.
-- Changed the rendering properties of the notes within a sequence's non-active channels, both in their default state and while selected.
-- Started locally keeping track of userprefs' version number, and added a mechanism to update old userprefs versions.
-- The dummy-file used to test the save-directory's validity will now be deleted.

1.0.3
-- Fixed savefile corruption that would be caused by switchSequences under certain circumstances.
-- Added pasteRepeating, a repeating-paste command.

1.0.2
-- Cursor will now move to the sequence's first note after loadFile.
-- Put a roundNum onto post-loadFile BPM values.

1.0.1
-- Changed cursor images from GIF to PNG.
-- Added a canary mechanism to reject false savepaths.

1.0
