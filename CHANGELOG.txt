1.1

-- TODO: Add a "CMD mode", where a sequence's non-NOTE commands are held and modified.
---- sub-task DONE: Remove all halfhearted Non-Note compensation from Note commands (as in, data.acceptmidi-related routines), and write new explicitly Non-Note-handling routines.
---- sub-task: Split Cmd Funtions into a new func-file.
---- sub-task: Add Cmd Mode versions of deleteTickNotes and deleteBeatNotes.
---- sub-task: In Cmd Mode, render item-text after/above cmd-rectangles.
---- sub-task: Show the active sequence's Cmd Mode commands as Shadow Mode notes, with unique coloration, when Cmd Mode isn't active.
---- sub-task: Check whether saveFile and loadFile are truly compatible with non-NOTE commands.
---- sub-task: Fix mouse-click position, to compensate for new anchor-point caused by changing piano-roll positioning.

-- TODO: Add full MIDI-IN, for composition via external MIDI devices. Thanks to how Spacing and Play Mode interact with note-entry, there won't need to be any explicit tabbing between input-types.
---- sub-task: Update the LOVE-to-Pd MIDI-OSC Bridge to grab MIDI-IN and send it to Sect.

-- TODO: Add native MIDI I/O on Windows, via lovemidi.
---- sub-task: Add mechanism to detect all MIDI devices, and tab between them, refreshing said list on every tab. This should only take effect, and its status should only be displayed, if lovemidi is present.

-- TODO: In Play Mode, notes from Shadow Mode sequences should play alongside notes from the active sequence.

-- TODO: comment out console again

-- TODO: change data.version back to "1.1"

-- Changed all data-structures and data-handling involved with mode-based interpretation of key-commands.
-- Started clipping the left edges of beat-triangles properly, now that Cmd Mode's GUI visually requires it.
-- Compensated for a stray vertical grey line off the bottom edge of the piano-roll that would disappear in Cmd Mode.
-- Fixed the piano-roll's connection to the Reticule's user-defined Y-anchor position.
-- Started accepting repeated commands from held-down keys.
-- Started removing all active keystrokes on focus-change.
-- Changed all note-deletion commands to only act upon notes of the currently active channel.
-- Changed selection-commands and getNotes, so that only notes on the active channel are selected in a given selection-command.
-- Changed some note-functions so they won't overwrite notes that sit on different channels within the same sequence, when they share pitch values.
-- Changed shiftInternalValue so that values multiplied by numbers less than 1 will be floored, rather than rounded. This will allow for easier reduction of Spacing to 0.
-- Changed the rendering properties of the notes within a sequence's non-active channels, both in their default state and while selected.
-- Started locally keeping track of userprefs' version number, and added a mechanism to update old userprefs versions.
-- The dummy-file used to test the save-directory's validity will now be deleted.

1.0.3
-- Fixed savefile corruption that would be caused by switchSequences under certain circumstances.
-- Added pasteRepeating, a repeating-paste command.

1.0.2
-- Cursor will now move to the sequence's first note after loadFile.
-- Put a roundNum onto post-loadFile BPM values.

1.0.1
-- Changed cursor images from GIF to PNG.
-- Added a canary mechanism to reject false savepaths.

1.0
-- Initial release.
