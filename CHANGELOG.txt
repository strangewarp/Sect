1.2

-- TODO: Add cross-platform native MIDI I/O.

1.1.1

-- TODO: Remove unnecessary 'undo-suppression' vars from function-calls and undo-funcs.
-- TODO: Refactor GUI rendering pathway to reduce lag.
-- TODO: Allow Quantize to affect non-note commands.
-- TODO: Allow item-movement to affect non-note commands.

1.1

-- TODO: Simplify screwy rendering of beat-triangles at edges of seq-panel

-- TODO: Fix the colorization of backgrounds of cells in the track-panel

-- TODO: Rename original loadFile to additiveLoadFile, and create a new destructive loadFile function.

-- TODO: Add a simple metronome in Play Mode, which plays a tick on every multiple of the Quantize value.
---- sub-task: Sync metronome with Entry-Quantize value.
---- sub-task: On TPQ-change, reset metro value to TPQ value.

-- TODO: Test all commands thoroughly again, to check for bugs caused by refactoring / new features.

-- TODO: Remove 'if not data.active then return nil end' checks from all functions, because on-keycommand seq checking makes them extraneous.

-- TODO: Make hotseat-toggling and loadFile commands available when no sequences are loaded.

-- TODO: remove "debugging" messages
-- TODO: comment out console again
-- TODO: change data.version back to "1.1"

-- REMINDER: Data structures:
---- data.seq[a].tick[b].note[c][d] = a single unique note (c=chan, d=pitch)
---- data.seq[a].tick[b].cmd[c] = {... that channel's non-note cmds}

-- REMINDER: Selection data structures:
---- data.seloffset = distance that seldat tick 1 is offset from tick-pointer
---- data.seldat[tick][chan][pitch] = a single unique note

* New features:
-- Added "CMD mode", where a sequence's non-NOTE commands are held and modified.
-- Added "Factor" commands, which toggle highlighting of factor-ticks within the current beat-value, with TPQ*4 as its default setting.
-- Added an "Entry-Quantize" toggle, which makes incoming notes and cmds stick to the nearest Factor-Display-tick.
-- Added "Stretch" command, which multiplies the duration and the starting tick of every selected note (or every note in the sequence, if none are selected), by global spacing/duration, rounded to the nearest tick-value.
-- Added "Quantize" command, which snaps all selected notes in the active sequence to ticks that are multiples of data.spacing.
-- Added "Select Chan" command, a version of Select-All that only applies to notes in the active seq's active channel.
-- Added Cmd Mode versions of various editor commands.
-- Added full MIDI-IN, for composition via external MIDI devices. Due to how Spacing and Play Mode interact with note-entry, there doesn't need to be any explicit tabbing between input-types.
-- Created a two-way MIDI-over-UDP communications system, designed to send MIDI between Sect and user devices, via SectMidiClient.

* GUI changes:
-- Started rendering notes on non-active channels in reverse channel order, with highest channels underneath, and lowest channels on top. Active channel's notes are rendered on top of that.
-- Started showing the active sequence's Cmd Mode commands as Shadow Mode notes, with unique coloration, when Cmd Mode isn't active; and also when a sequence with non-NOTE commands is a Shadow Mode sequence.
-- Changed how Shadow Mode is applied to a sequence's NOTE commands while Cmd Mode is active.
-- Added a visual confirmation on file-save.
-- Started rendering a shadow under every note's channel-number.
-- Started clipping the left edges of beat-triangles properly, now that Cmd Mode's GUI visually requires it.
-- Compensated for a stray vertical grey line off the bottom edge of the piano-roll that would disappear in Cmd Mode.
-- Fixed the piano-roll's connection to the Reticule's user-defined Y-anchor position.
-- Started accepting repeated commands from held-down keys.
-- Now allow multiple computer-keyboard keys to be pressed simultaneously, so that example-chords can be sent across UDP to external MIDI devices.
-- Started removing all active keystrokes on focus-change.
-- Changed the rendering properties of the notes within a sequence's non-active channels, both in their default state and while selected.

* Logic changes:
-- Changed all modNotes/modCmds calls to use a "multiply" value, as some calls need to multiply the shift-value by data.spacing, while others don't.
-- Refactored data-structures so that tick tables themselves are also sparse; and added a "total" variable to each seq table to keep track of how many ticks are in a sequence.
-- Wrote buildTable, getIndex, getContents, seqUnsetCascade, and copyUnsetCascade, which manipulate strictly-defined sparse tables within the new data-structure-space. This allows notes to be stored explicitly, rather than in unordered tables; and yet also prevents said storage from incurring massive lag.
-- Converted all manipulations within the space of "data.seq[n].tick" to use the new functions in index-funcs.lua, rather than touching the tables directly.
-- Changed data-structures to be in the format of "data.seq[a].tick[b].note[c][d]", "data.seq[a].tick[b].cmd[c]", "data.seldat[a][b][c]", and "data.copydat[a][b][c]".
-- Bounded Generator Mode scale-size and wheel-size to 7 (used to be 8), to make active data tables more sane.
-- Changed Play Mode behavior, to repeat the contents of smaller sequences across larger sequences.
-- Removed moveNotes, and rewrote modNotes to make more sense.
-- Fixed an old function-call inside of removeTicks that was likely causing buggy behavior in certain situations.
-- Fixed a potentially fatal bug in the interaction of deleteBeatNotes and getNotes.
-- normalizePointers will now halt Play Mode if all sequences are deleted.
-- Added a "funcgate" mechanism to executeFunction, so that undo commands stay functional during the proper times, due to changes incurred by its command-blocking mechanism.
-- Modified executeFunction to start blocking commands that try to access or modify the data.seq table, whenever data.active is false. Also removed more primitive versions of this functionality from some individual commands.
-- Changed all data-structures and data-handling involved with mode-based interpretation of key-commands.
-- Removed old OSC and Extrovert-API code, which was clunky and extraneous.
-- Changed all note-deletion commands to only act upon notes of the currently active channel.
-- Changed some note-functions so they won't overwrite notes that sit on different channels within the same sequence, when they share pitch values.
-- Changed shiftInternalValue so that values multiplied by numbers less than 1 will be floored, rather than rounded. This will allow for easier reduction of Spacing to 0.
-- Started locally keeping track of userprefs' version number, and added a mechanism to update old userprefs versions.

1.0.3
-- Fixed savefile corruption that would be caused by switchSequences under certain circumstances.
-- Added pasteRepeating, a repeating-paste command.

1.0.2
-- Cursor will now move to the sequence's first note after loadFile.
-- Put a roundNum onto post-loadFile BPM values.

1.0.1
-- Changed cursor images from GIF to PNG.
-- Added a canary mechanism to reject false savepaths.

1.0
-- Initial release.
