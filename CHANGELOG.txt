1.1
-- TODO: Seperate notes in every sequence by channel.
-- TODO: Modify all note, seq, and GUI commands to act according to channel-seqs.
-- TODO: Make all of a seq's channels automatically visible in Shadow Mode.

-- TODO: Add a "0th channel", where a sequence's non-NOTE commands are held.
-- TODO: Add a unique view-mode for the "0th channel", based on stacking, rather than repeating-grid. 0th-channel seq-space should be parsed as normal seq-space, but POINTER_PREV_NOTE and POINTER_NEXT_NOTE should be triggered by the POINTER_UP and POINTER_DOWN buttons.
-- TODO: Add variables: "COMMAND TYPE", "BYTE VAL 1", and "BYTE VAL 2", which can be tabbed through when the "0th channel" is active, via "NOTE", "DURATION", and "VELOCITY" keys.

-- TODO: Add full MIDI-IN, for composition via external MIDI devices.
-- TODO: Add native MIDI I/O on Windows, via lovemidi.

-- TODO: comment out console again
